### JavaScript Solution

The approach involves iterating through both linked lists, digit by digit, adding the corresponding digits along with any carry from the previous addition. The result is stored in a new linked list.

#### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `carry` to handle the carry-over during addition.
   - `dummyHead` as a placeholder to build the result linked list.
   - `current` to track the current node in the result list.

2. **Iterate Through the Linked Lists**:
   - While there are still nodes to process in either list or there is a carry, continue looping.
   - Retrieve the current digit from each list, defaulting to 0 if the list is exhausted.
   - Compute the sum of the digits plus the carry.
   - Update the carry for the next iteration.
   - Create a new node with the resulting digit and attach it to the result list.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - The result is stored starting from `dummyHead.next` since `dummyHead` was a placeholder.

Here is the JavaScript code implementing this logic:

```javascript
// Definition for singly-linked list.
function ListNode(val, next = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.next = next;
}

function addTwoNumbers(l1, l2) {
    let dummyHead = new ListNode(0);
    let current = dummyHead;
    let carry = 0;

    while (l1 !== null || l2 !== null || carry !== 0) {
        let sum = carry;

        if (l1 !== null) {
            sum += l1.val;
            l1 = l1.next;
        }

        if (l2 !== null) {
            sum += l2.val;
            l2 = l2.next;
        }

        carry = Math.floor(sum / 10);
        current.next = new ListNode(sum % 10);
        current = current.next;
    }

    return dummyHead.next;
}
```

### Example Usage

```javascript
// Helper function to create a linked list from an array
function createLinkedList(arr) {
    let dummyHead = new ListNode(0);
    let current = dummyHead;
    arr.forEach(val => {
        current.next = new ListNode(val);
        current = current.next;
    });
    return dummyHead.next;
}

// Helper function to print linked list
function printLinkedList(node) {
    let current = node;
    let result = [];
    while (current !== null) {
        result.push(current.val);
        current = current.next;
    }
    console.log(result.join(' -> '));
}

// Example linked lists
let l1 = createLinkedList([2, 4, 3]);
let l2 = createLinkedList([5, 6, 4]);

// Adding the two numbers
let result = addTwoNumbers(l1, l2);

// Print the result
printLinkedList(result); // Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
```

### Explanation of Example

- `l1` represents the number 342 (in reverse order as 2 -> 4 -> 3).
- `l2` represents the number 465 (in reverse order as 5 -> 6 -> 4).
- The sum is 807, represented in reverse order as 7 -> 0 -> 8.

This solution ensures that the sum of two numbers represented by linked lists is correctly computed and returned as a new linked list.
